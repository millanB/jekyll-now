    <td>I learnt by using logical thinking when getting stuck and I would then go back to previous bits of code to see what I did, what strategies were effective and how I could then implement the techniques in the question I was stuck on.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

    <td>When I got stuck on the code and what to do I would sometime lose focus and stop trying to get the answer, and then give up and asked my friends what to do instead of working it out myself.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time when I get stuck I will keep persevering instead of asking for the answer to the question only if i have tried for a long time and still can't work it out.</td>
